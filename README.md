README: Enhanced Object Detection Model
Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the performance of computer vision models for accurate object detection in video data, specifically targeting cars and trucks. By addressing key challenges in object detection and improving model parameters, this trained model delivers precise and reliable results, making it ideal for applications in smart industries.

Key Features
1️⃣ Accurate Detection: Distinguishes between cars and trucks with high precision in video frames.
2️⃣ Resolved Ambiguity: Eliminates confusion between similar objects like trucks and buses.
3️⃣ Improved Timing: Avoids premature object detection, ensuring better confidence scores.
4️⃣ Optimized Parameters: Fine-tuned for robust performance across various scenarios.

Challenges Addressed
Ambiguity in Detection: The original model struggled to differentiate between trucks and buses, leading to inconsistent results.
Premature Detection: Initial detections occurred too early, compromising confidence values when the full object became visible.
The trained model now resolves these challenges, delivering sharper and more accurate detections.

Applications
This model can be applied in various fields, including:

Smart Industries: Enhancing automation and monitoring in manufacturing and logistics.
Traffic Monitoring: Improving vehicle detection in traffic surveillance systems.
Fleet Management: Providing precise vehicle identification for fleet tracking and analytics.
